Specification Requirements:
    Prompt the user for the number of players. This does not include the dealer. You may have 1 - 5 players
    Each player starts with $100 in their account
    A player can continue until they are out of money
    Each round
        Prompt each player one at a time for their bet amount.
        Display the current balance for each user as part of their prompt
        The minimum bet is $5 or their entire balance, whichever is lower
    Deal the cards
        Each round will have a fresh deck of shuffled cards
        Cards are dealt one at a time beginning with player 1 and ending with the dealer
        Each player (including the dealer) gets two cards, meaning there will be two cycles of dealing cards to each player.
        After dealing all cards display the dealer's second card
        For each player starting with player 1
    Show the player hand
        Ask the player if they'd hit (take another card) or hold
        Repeat until they hold or bust (total of cards is over 21)
        If they bust they lose
        If the player holds then the next player goes
    After all players are done the dealer complete its turn
        Display both dealer cards (print each on a new line)
        Use time.sleep() to wait for 1 second before dealing another card(s) to the dealer
        The dealer must take a card until its total is 17 or higher
        If the dealer's initial hand is 17 or higher it does not take a card
        Use appropriate messages so the players know what the dealer is doing
    Determining winners
        If the dealer busts (goes over 21), all players who did not bust win
        If the player and dealer totals are the same they tie
        If the players hand is lower than the dealer, the player loses
        Use appropriate messages to let each player know what their result is
    Player payouts
        Win - add the amount bet to the player's balance
        Tie - neither add nor subtract from the player's balance
        Lose - subtract the amount bet from the player's balance
        Display each user's balance (including those who have lost all their money)
    Ask to Play again
        Yes: Repeat the round for all players with more than a $0 balance.
        No:
            Print a Thank You message
            Print each player's name (their player number) and balance starting with the one with the highest. You should perform a sort first.
    Notes
        This is not quite real blackjack.
        The player and dealer will not automatically win if they have Blackjack (21 on the first hand)
        There is no doubling down or insurance
    Card values
        Numeric cards are worth the same number of points
        Ace is worth eleven points unless the total of all cards exceeds 21, then it is counted as one.
        Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points
        Use the full card name, not the nickname for this task
        Do not use variables for individual player data.
        You should use lists that are sized appropriately for the number of players selected
        Use a single multidimensional list to manage the hands for all players and the dealer
        Use other appropriate list(s) to manage the account balance for each player and wagers
        Use appropriate prompts so it is clear which player should be playing and what their options are
        Use appropriate messages so players know what is happening in the game
        You should not modify the card or deck files
System Analysis:
    Calculate Player's balance
    Calculate amount on player's cards in their hands
    Calculate whether of not player's hand total is greater or less than 21
    If player wins, add bet amount to balance
    if player loses, subtract bet amount from balance
